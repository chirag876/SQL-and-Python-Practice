string1 = 'f;u{}'
result = max(string1)
print("The maximum alphabetic character in the string is:", result)

'''In this example, '}' has the highest ASCI I value (125) among al l the characters in 
the string 'f;u{}' , making it the maximum alphabetical character. The max 
function is a straightforward tool for finding the maximum character in a 
string, even when it contains a combination of alphabetic and special 
characters.'''
